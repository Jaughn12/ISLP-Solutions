# ISLR Chapter Exercise Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the exercises from the book *Introduction to Statistical Learning* (ISLR). Each chapterâ€™s exercises are divided into two parts:

- **Conceptual solutions:** Written in LaTeX, focusing on theoretical explanations and derivations.
- **Applied solutions:** Implemented in Python, showcasing practical coding exercises and data analysis.
